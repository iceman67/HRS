Time series is a series of data points ordered with respect to time.  Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Its data is used to interpret a phenomina based on the result from identifying the components of a trend, cyclicity and seasonality. The result may be applied for predicting its future values. 

- trend analysis to determine whether it is linear or not as most models require this information as input
- outliers detection to understand how to spot and handle them 
- stationarity test to understand if we can assume that the time series is stationary or not
- seasonality analysis to determine what is the best seasonal parameter to use when modeling.
