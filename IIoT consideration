IIoT applications connect machines and devices in such industries as oil and gas, utilities and manufacturing. 
The physical environments for industrial-connected devices can vary. 
Hence sensors can be installed in vary harsh conditions including high heat, extreme cold, high humidity, and poor ventilation. 
When designing the monitoring system with those devices, we mainly focused on improving efficiency and health and safety 
as compared to other types of IoT.
